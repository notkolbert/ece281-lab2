2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[5]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[0]/CLR,
SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[3]/CLR,
SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[4]/CLR
SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[6]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[2]/CLR
SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin SEVEN_SEGMENT_DECODER/o_seg_n_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 7 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
